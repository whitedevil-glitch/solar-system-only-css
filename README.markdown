# Solar System Explorer in CSS only

I didn't know much of JS so I created this CSS only project. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

Check out this site live <a href="https://solarsystem-explorer.netlify.app/" target=_blank>here</a>

Explore the planets and moons of our solar system in pure CSS. Not a single line of JS used throughout, only images are planet textures taken from royalty free sites. Information about planets taken from space.com.
